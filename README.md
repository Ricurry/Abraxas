### Custom Checksum and Custom Protocols!

It's a work in progress, of course. But, I have gotten steady progress, and due to work on previous projects, I can import some libraries from them to cut down costs of time.

The main solution for my checksum is coded in C++, and the verification process is multithreaded.

There are also various other treaty features, such as multithread message compression and peer verifying.

Most of it is written in mind for Linux systems, so Windows users, wait abit before I can create a solution for you bunch!
